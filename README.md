# Disaster Response Pipeline Project

### Summary:
In this project, the Boston Airbnb open Data set is analyzed to answer three business questions:

	- What is the average price per guest in each neighbourhood?
	- Which neighbourhood has the highest rated listings?
	- Which factors have the most influence on the price?

Within a Jupyter notebook the CRIPS-DM process is applied, including data preparation (gathering, handling of categorical data, handling of missing data), analysis, modeling and visualization.
